	Kth Permutation Sequence	

	The set [1,2,3,â€¦,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

	By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
	We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3 ) :

	1. "123"
	2. "132"
	3. "213"
	4. "231"
	5. "312"
	6. "321"
	Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

	For example, given n = 3, k = 4, ans = "231"
